# Learning Solana

This repo is purely for experimentation and learning as part of learning Solana.
Things are expected to break often or be incomplete.

It contains various projects that are used to learn Solana:
- [svelte-app](./svelte-app/README.md) - A Svelte app that uses the Solana Web3 library to interact with the Solana blockchain.
- [hello_cargo](./hello_cargo/README.md) - Introduction to Cargo & Rust.
